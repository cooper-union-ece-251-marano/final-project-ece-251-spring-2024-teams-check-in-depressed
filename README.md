# Catalog of Verilog Components to Build and Simulate a MIPS-based RISC.

Created by: Tiffany Shum and Lani Wang

Inspired by Prof Marano and Harris & Harris's MIPS implementations.

We chose a single-cycle, non-pipelined implementation.

# Instruction Set Architecture

### Instruction Fields

The CPU supports 16 instructions from the core MIPS architecture set. For simplicity, the 16 instruction bits were divided evenly into four fields. The first is a 4-bit opcode, which combines the functionality of both ‘opcode’ and ‘funct’ from MIPS to determine which instruction should be performed. The following 3 fields represent input and output registers (R-type instructions), input/output register and the immediate (constant) to be used (I-type). For J-type instructions, the 12 bits are combined into one field that specifies an address. 

### Control Signals

Based on the 4-bit instruction opcode, 8 control signals are generated. ALUop, which determines which arithmetic operation is to be performed by the ALU, is generated by the ALU decoder. The rest are determined by the main decoder. They function as follows:

RegWrite – enables a write to one of the registers.  
RegDst – determines whether the destination register is rd or rt    
Branch – only used for beq, enables loading branch address to the PC.    
MemWrite – enables a write to memory.    
MemToReg – determines the source of a value written to a register.    
Jump – enables loading a jump target address to the PC.    
ALUsrc – determines whether the second source operand for ALU instructions is rt or the (sign-extended) immediate field.
